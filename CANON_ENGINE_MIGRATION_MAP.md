# CANON_ENGINE_MIGRATION_MAP — P3-CANON-01 reconciliation

## Authority and donor state

Current implementation authority is `Filatotel/codex` current `main` at materialization start.

Historical donor only:

- PR #28 — `Migrate new-book-skills into Canon Engine`
- donor HEAD: `2cc651826025116a76c962b4c725c4a718b28459`
- historical source snapshot: `Filatotel/new-book-skills@ed29f77cf94b7ce3f6e12a66ab8a60268adca660`
- historical meaningful-file accounting: **190/190**

PR #28 is not merged, rebased, continued, or treated as current acceptance authority. Its semantic material and inventory are donor evidence only.

## Historical 190/190 accounting preserved

| Historical class | Count | Current treatment |
|---|---:|---|
| `MOVE_TO_CANON_ENGINE` | 14 | reconciled into active Canon where still semantically compatible |
| `CONVERT_TO_OPTIONAL_PATTERN` | 13 | DEFERRED; no universal literary ontology activated |
| `SUPERSEDE` | 5 | SUPERSEDED by current Resolver/root contracts or current Canon lifecycle |
| `EXTRACT_TO_COMMON_PROTOCOL` | 1 | DEFERRED; current shared protocols remain authoritative |
| `EXTRACT_TO_SHARED_KERNEL` | 1 | DEFERRED; no kernel expansion in this workstream |
| `MOVE_TO_LIBRARY` | 2 | DEFERRED; no library lifecycle expansion |
| `MOVE_TO_PRODUCTION_WRITING_FUTURE` | 45 | DEFERRED; Writing/Production not activated |
| `MOVE_TO_TRANSLATION_FUTURE` | 15 | DEFERRED; Translation not activated |
| `MOVE_TO_OTHER_ENGINE_FUTURE` | 54 | DEFERRED; Interactive/release/tooling/future engines not activated |
| `ARCHIVE_AS_EVIDENCE` | 40 | COMPATIBLE as historical evidence only, never runtime authority |

Total remains **190**. The accounting is preserved rather than re-derived from scratch.

## Current-main reconciliation disposition

### COMPATIBLE

The following donor semantics remain valid and are selectively reused:

- bounded Canon ownership: Foundation 0.x, state registration, reconciliation, Canon-specific change classification, internal validation, freeze, reopen;
- lifecycle `0.x → Research → reconciliation → Canon 1.0 → Production → final reconciliation → Canon 2.0`;
- explicit-over-inferred authority;
- stable semantic IDs and provenance;
- `UNKNOWN != AMBIGUITY != CONTRADICTION`;
- no silent conflict winner;
- scoped freeze/reopen with preserved lineage;
- `RESEARCH → EVIDENCE/FINDINGS → CANON RECONCILIATION → ACCEPTED CANON`;
- implementation, translation, tests, and Verification do not self-create Canon truth;
- donor Canon docs and 11 core skill semantics, after current execution-contract reconciliation.

### NEEDS_CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_RECONCILIATION — MATERIALIZED HERE

- Canon `MANIFEST.yaml` against current assignment compiler/executability architecture;
- common Project Resolver artifact envelope in all active durable Canon schemas/templates;
- additional durable schemas/templates for change proposal, reconciliation result, and freeze record;
- explicit executing/consuming role contract for every workflow;
- exact required/optional skill composition per workflow;
- explicit upstream requirements per workflow;
- execution prerequisites for all active Canon skills;
- root Router progressive disclosure using all declared mandatory workflow skills;
- root System Manifest active registry/capability/entry-condition registration;
- representative use through generic `tools/resolver_spawn.py`, without a Canon-specific resolver brain.

### SUPERSEDED

- PR #28 root `ROUTER.md` and `SYSTEM_MANIFEST.yaml` as current control authority;
- donor Canon schema/template shapes that omit the common artifact envelope;
- prose-only/implicit workflow role selection;
- registration routing that can load one skill while omitting other mandatory workflow skills;
- legacy direct Seed→frozen-Canon orchestration incompatible with the current Research/reconciliation lifecycle;
- source-local root/skill contracts where current Project Resolver contracts now govern.

### DEFERRED

- optional literary Canon/Foundation patterns;
- Production Foundation and generic Foundation Engine;
- Writing/Production future material (historical 45);
- Translation future material (historical 15);
- Interactive, release, proof/toolchain and other future engine material (historical 54);
- generic change-protocol extraction, shared-kernel reference tooling, and library-maintenance tooling.

No deferred future engine is activated by P3-CANON-01.

## Materialization result boundary

This map is migration evidence, not runtime routing authority. Runtime selection is `SYSTEM_MANIFEST.yaml` → `ROUTER.md` → `engines/canon/MANIFEST.yaml` → exact workflow/roles/skills → generic compilation/executability/admissibility proof.

PR #28 disposition: **USED_AS_DONOR / DO NOT MERGE**.
