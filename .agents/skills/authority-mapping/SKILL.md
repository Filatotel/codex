# Authority Mapping

## Purpose

Use this skill when a system has multiple components that can observe, store, transform, project, cache, or mutate the same conceptual state.

## Goal

Make decision ownership explicit before implementation so the system does not accidentally create competing sources of truth.

This skill does **not** prescribe server authority, client authority, event sourcing, databases, state machines, or any particular architecture. It asks which component is authoritative for each decision in the architecture you actually choose.

## When to use

Use when:

- UI, API, storage, cache, workers, queues, generated artifacts, or external services interact;
- multiple subsystems write one shared record or session;
- a read model/projection may be mistaken for writable source state;
- stale clients or concurrent actors can observe different revisions;
- recovery behavior depends on knowing what has already become authoritative;
- a refactor moves logic across boundaries.

## Do not use when

Do not use this skill to:

- force all authority into one process;
- replace domain modeling;
- justify a centralized coordinator for every system;
- label every value "authoritative" without specifying the decision it owns.

## Inputs

- conceptual facts or decisions in the feature;
- components that read/write them;
- persistence and transport boundaries;
- external systems involved;
- existing contracts and invariants.

## Required output

An authority map. Minimum shape:

| Decision / fact | Authority owner | Allowed writers | Readers / projections | Persistence / carrier | Conflict rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Also record any unresolved authority conflict.

## Procedure

### 1. Name decisions, not containers

Bad:

```text
Database is authoritative.
```

Better:

```text
Order payment status is accepted only by payment-confirmation logic.
The database stores the accepted result.
```

A storage location can carry authority without being the component that decides meaning.

### 2. Separate these roles

For each important state item, distinguish where applicable:

- **decision authority** — decides whether a transition/fact is accepted;
- **writer** — may persist or publish the accepted result;
- **carrier** — transports/stores state;
- **projection** — read-only or reduced view;
- **presentation** — displays state;
- **observer** — records evidence about state;
- **external authority** — third-party system whose decision the product must respect.

One component may hold several roles, but do not assume that automatically.

### 3. Identify illegal authority elevation

Look for patterns such as:

- UI appearance being treated as proof a command succeeded;
- cache contents overriding newer source state;
- analytics/observer data being replayed as canonical business state;
- a generated artifact silently redefining its source contract;
- a partial writer reconstructing a shared object and dropping fields it does not own;
- a stale client overwriting a newer revision;
- a transport retry being interpreted as a new domain action.

### 4. Define mutation ownership

For shared state, specify which subsystem owns each field or transition.

A subsystem that does not own a field should normally preserve it, ignore it, or operate through the owning interface—not reconstruct it from a partial local model.

### 5. Define conflict behavior

For every place two authorities could disagree, choose an explicit rule:

- reject stale mutation;
- reconcile from owner;
- merge by declared field ownership;
- compensate;
- require human/operational resolution;
- fail closed;
- fail open where correctness allows.

Do not let "last response wins" become an accidental conflict policy.

### 6. Audit projections

A projection may intentionally omit information. Record whether it is:

- read-only;
- stale-tolerant;
- safe to cache;
- safe to expose publicly;
- sufficient for a specific consumer;
- forbidden as a mutation source.

## Decision rules

- Authority is scoped to a **decision**, not awarded to a technology category.
- Having a copy of data does not grant mutation authority.
- Presentation and observability do not automatically create domain facts.
- A retry does not automatically create a new intent.
- Shared state needs explicit ownership or an explicit merge rule.
- If two components can independently make contradictory decisions about the same fact, the architecture has an unresolved authority conflict.

## Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- "the frontend knows" / "the backend knows" without naming the fact;
- global singleton coordinators added only to hide unclear ownership;
- treating database rows as self-interpreting truth;
- reconstructing authoritative state from logs because the actual owner is inconvenient;
- exposing a full internal object when a bounded projection is sufficient;
- allowing multiple partial writers to replace one shared envelope/document wholesale.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Every important decision has an owner.
- [ ] Writers and readers are distinguished from decision authority.
- [ ] Projections cannot silently become mutation sources.
- [ ] Shared-state field ownership is explicit where needed.
- [ ] Stale/concurrent conflicts have a declared rule.
- [ ] Recovery paths respect already-authoritative decisions.
- [ ] No technology is declared globally authoritative without a scoped reason.

## Pair with

- `dependency-ownership` for workstream/component boundaries;
- `irreversible-boundary-reasoning` for accepted effects that cannot be replayed;
- `exact-state-verification` for revision/provenance checks;
- `implementation-planning` before multi-system changes.
