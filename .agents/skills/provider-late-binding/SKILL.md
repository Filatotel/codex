# Provider Late Binding

> Classification: **Solution Pattern — optional**. This is one way to keep an external provider from becoming the first dependency of a feature. It is useful when deterministic integration can be proven behind a provider-neutral seam, but it is not a rule that every third-party integration must be added last.

## Problem class

A feature depends on an external provider—CAPTCHA, payment, identity, SMS, email, storage, AI, maps, or another service—but most application semantics can be developed and tested without the live provider. Integrating the real provider too early can make business/runtime debugging inseparable from credentials, network behavior, provider UI, rate limits, and environment-specific configuration.

## Production trace

This pattern came from a human-verification entry flow where the application contract, consent boundary, session behavior, test traversal, and failure semantics could all be proven through a provider-neutral seam before the live verification widget/script/network/secret was enabled in production.

## Assumptions

- the application can define a provider-neutral contract around the external capability;
- a deterministic fake/test implementation can reproduce the outcomes needed for most integration work;
- the real provider adds operational/network/UI behavior beyond the core domain contract;
- final production certification will still test the actual provider.

## Use when

Use when:

- external provider credentials are unavailable or undesirable in ordinary CI;
- provider UI/network behavior would make early debugging noisy;
- most application logic depends on provider outcomes, not provider internals;
- you want a deterministic full-flow soak before enabling production-only integration;
- switching providers later is a realistic possibility.

## Do not use when

Integrate the real provider earlier when:

- provider behavior fundamentally defines the product workflow;
- the provider API itself is the unknown risk being investigated;
- no realistic fake can exercise critical semantics;
- compliance/certification requires the live provider throughout development;
- provider-specific latency, callback ordering, redirects, or embedded UI are central to architecture.

## Pattern

### 1. Define the capability seam first

Model what the application needs, for example:

```text
verifyHuman(challengeContext) -> verified / rejected / unavailable
```

or

```text
capturePayment(command) -> accepted result / declined / uncertain
```

Do not expose provider SDK objects throughout the domain/application layer unless necessary.

### 2. Implement a deterministic test provider

The fake should support the meaningful outcome classes, including failures.

Examples:

- success;
- explicit rejection;
- transient unavailable;
- timeout/uncertain result where relevant;
- malformed provider response if the adapter must handle it.

The fake is not evidence that the real provider works. It is evidence that the application contract around provider outcomes works.

### 3. Dogfood the integrated application without the live provider

Exercise:

- full happy path;
- resume/restart;
- failure/recovery;
- concurrency/stale state;
- accessibility/mobile behavior;
- downstream workflows;
- terminal/release boundaries.

This reduces the number of unknowns before live integration.

### 4. Add the real provider adapter late in the feature sequence

Implement only the adapter-specific concerns:

- SDK/script/network wiring;
- secrets/config;
- callback mapping;
- provider error normalization;
- CSP/origin requirements;
- production environment setup.

Keep application semantics behind the same seam.

### 5. Run provider-specific certification

The real provider still needs tests for what the fake cannot prove:

- production credentials/config;
- browser/widget behavior;
- redirects/callbacks;
- network failure;
- origin/CSP constraints;
- provider-specific retry/idempotency;
- actual accessibility behavior where applicable.

### 6. Keep fallback policy explicit

Decide what happens if the provider is unavailable:

- block safely;
- fail open;
- retry;
- offer alternative provider/path;
- degrade functionality.

This is a product/security decision, not something the pattern chooses universally.

## Why it works

It isolates domain/application correctness from provider-specific operational complexity. By the time the real provider is attached, most failures can be classified as adapter/provider issues rather than unknown whole-system behavior.

## Trade-offs

- a fake can diverge from real provider behavior;
- maintaining a seam adds abstraction;
- late discovery of provider constraints can still force redesign;
- some provider-specific UX cannot be tested until late;
- over-generalizing the seam can create unnecessary indirection.

## Alternatives

Consider instead:

- integrate the provider immediately and use its sandbox/test environment throughout;
- run contract tests against a provider emulator;
- use a local proxy/record-replay harness;
- accept provider lock-in and design directly against its SDK;
- perform a short spike with the real provider first, then decide whether a seam is valuable.

## Failure modes

- fake models only success and hides real failure classes;
- application starts depending on fake-only fields;
- provider adapter leaks SDK objects into all layers;
- team treats fake soak as production provider certification;
- live integration happens so late that untested hard constraints appear at release time;
- fallback behavior is accidentally defined by provider SDK defaults;
- provider-specific security checks are abstracted away incorrectly.

## Verification

- application full-flow tests pass with deterministic fake across declared outcome classes;
- domain/application code depends on the capability contract rather than provider globals where intended;
- real adapter maps provider outcomes into the same contract;
- provider-specific integration tests cover constraints absent from the fake;
- live-provider failure behavior follows explicit product policy;
- replacing the fake with the real provider does not silently change unrelated application semantics.

## Related Core Principles

- `dependency-ownership` — external provider is a dependency with its own integration/release gate;
- `authority-mapping` — define which provider outcome is authoritative and what the application owns;
- `irreversible-boundary-reasoning` — some provider calls may create non-repeatable effects;
- `evidence-and-authority` — fake integration evidence and live-provider evidence prove different claims.
