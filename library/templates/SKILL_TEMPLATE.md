# Skill Name

## Purpose

Use this skill when TODO.

## Goal

TODO: one or two sentences explaining the outcome this skill should reliably produce.

## When to use

Use this skill when:

- TODO
- TODO

Do not use this skill when:

- TODO

## Inputs

Collect only what is needed:

- task goal
- repository or project context
- files, systems, or pages in scope
- constraints and non-goals
- required claims/evidence

## Execution contract

**Required execution capabilities for mandatory steps:**

- TODO, for example `repository_remote_read`, `repository_local_checkout`, `shell`, `python_runtime`, `interactive_browser`
- or explicitly: none beyond model reasoning / artifact reads

**Supported execution modes:**

| Mode | Required capabilities | Claim/evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO |

**Conditional / optional capabilities:**

- TODO

**Mandatory evidence paths and equivalent fallbacks:**

- TODO. If no equivalent fallback exists, say so.

**Unsupported environment behavior:**

- Before assignment: return/trigger `ASSIGNMENT_NOT_ADMISSIBLE` for missing mandatory capabilities.
- After a previously valid assignment loses a capability: return `BLOCKED_RUNTIME_DRIFT` with evidence.
- Never silently weaken a mandatory claim to fit the available runtime.

## Required outputs

Produce a concise result with:

- scope checked
- actions taken or recommended
- evidence
- unresolved risks
- final verdict: pass, partial, or fail

## Procedure

1. Inspect the current context before acting.
2. Restate the task in concrete terms.
3. Identify the smallest useful workflow and supported execution mode.
4. Perform only the required steps through capabilities proven by the assignment execution contract.
5. Record evidence and risks.
6. Use a clear verdict.

## Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- vague success claims
- hidden runtime/tool assumptions
- claiming a fallback is equivalent when it proves a weaker state
- unrelated refactors
- long generic essays
- hidden assumptions
- pretending verification happened
- overwriting durable workflow files without explicit intent

## Verification checklist

- [ ] The skill has a clear trigger.
- [ ] The procedure is actionable.
- [ ] Required execution capabilities are explicit for every mandatory external step.
- [ ] Supported execution modes and evidence boundaries are explicit.
- [ ] Unsupported-environment behavior is explicit.
- [ ] The required outputs are explicit.
- [ ] Known failure modes are listed.
- [ ] The skill does not duplicate an existing skill.
- [ ] The skill is short enough to load only when needed.

## Minimal verdict format

- Status
- Scope
- Execution mode
- Capabilities used
- Evidence
- Risks
- Next action
