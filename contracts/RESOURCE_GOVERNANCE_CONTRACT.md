# Resource Governance Contract

This contract freezes the provider-neutral Resource Governance interface for Project Resolver. It defines semantics only. It does not implement forecasting, persistence, runtime adapters, CI, or Resolver behavior.

## Core separation

```text
SEMANTIC AUTHORITY
!= EXECUTABILITY
!= RESOURCE AUTHORITY
!= RESOURCE AVAILABILITY
!= ACTUAL RESOURCE CONSUMPTION
```

```text
SPAWN_READY
=
SEMANTICALLY_COMPILED
AND EXECUTABLE
AND RESOURCE_AUTHORIZED
AND RESOURCE_AVAILABLE
```

`COMPILED_ASSIGNMENT` remains semantic compilation.

`ASSIGNMENT_ADMISSIBILITY` remains destination/runtime executability: `CAN EXECUTE`.

`RESOURCE_ADMISSION` is an orthogonal Resource Governance proof: `MAY CONSUME`.

Neither substitutes for the other.

Existing authority remains in:

- `contracts/ASSIGNMENT_COMPILATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `contracts/EXECUTABILITY_CONTRACT.md`
- `roles/control-director/ROLE.md`
- `roles/executor/ROLE.md`
- `roles/control-verifier/ROLE.md`

Cross-ownership is tracked by #56, #57, #59, #61, #62, and parent #68.

## Canonical lifecycle

```text
selected execution route
→ route-bound RESOURCE_ESTIMATE
→ finite RESOURCE_GRANT
→ RESOURCE_ADMISSION
→ governed consumption
→ USAGE_EVENT
→ RUN_ACCOUNTING
```

`ESTIMATE != AUTHORIZATION`.

A grant proves authority, not availability or consumption.

Accounting records facts; it does not create acceptance authority.

## Frozen governance vocabulary and extensible resource identifiers

`RESOURCE_CLASS` and `RESOURCE_DIMENSION` are provider-neutral identifier namespaces, not closed enums. Canonical identifiers use uppercase snake-case matching `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$`.

Baseline `RESOURCE_CLASS` identifiers are:

```text
MODEL_INFERENCE
REMOTE_CI
REMOTE_BROWSER
GPU_COMPUTE
PAID_TOOL
EXTERNAL_API
```

Baseline `RESOURCE_DIMENSION` identifiers are:

```text
USD
RUNNER_MINUTES
GPU_SECONDS
TOKENS
MODEL_CALLS
TOOL_CALLS
AGENT_SPAWNS
```

A new resource class or dimension does not require a contract amendment merely because a new governed resource is encountered. It MUST remain provider-neutral, MUST NOT redefine the meaning of an existing identifier, and MUST NOT change authority, admission, limit, metering, exhaustion, or unknown-state semantics. Provider/product identity belongs in route/provenance/measurement surfaces, not in the canonical resource identifier itself.

The following governance vocabularies are closed contract semantics.

### LIMIT_MODE

```text
HARD_LIMIT
RESERVABLE_LIMIT
OBSERVATION_ONLY
```

### METERING_QUALITY

```text
AUTHORITATIVE_ACTUAL
NORMALIZED_ACTUAL
ESTIMATED
UNKNOWN
```

### RESOURCE_ADMISSION_VERDICT

```text
ADMISSIBLE
NOT_ADMISSIBLE
```

### RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION_STATE

```text
NOT_EXHAUSTED
ORDINARY_LIMIT_EXHAUSTED_FINALIZATION_ONLY
EXHAUSTED
UNKNOWN
```

### UNKNOWN_RESOURCE_STATE

```text
KNOWN
ESTIMATE_UNKNOWN
ACTUAL_UNKNOWN
AVAILABILITY_UNKNOWN
METERING_UNAVAILABLE
```

Changing a closed governance state/mode or its meaning requires an explicit bounded contract amendment.

## Route-bound RESOURCE_ESTIMATE

An estimate used for admission MUST bind the selected route through `route_ref`.

The same semantic obligation may have different resource consequences on different execution surfaces, so a non-route-bound estimate is not admission-grade evidence.

The estimate may carry point estimates, generic quantiles, upper bounds, confidence, historical sample count, or explicit unknown state. This contract does not prescribe the forecasting algorithm.

## Finite RESOURCE_GRANT authority

`RESOURCE_GRANT` MUST distinguish:

```text
issued_by
authority_source
```

`issued_by` identifies the control role that materialized the grant.

`authority_source` identifies durable upstream resource authority. Supported authority-source families are Owner-approved resource authority, an autonomy envelope, a parent resource grant, or another explicit durable resource authority.

Materializing a grant does not create authority from nothing.

When `authority_source.authority_type=PARENT_RESOURCE_GRANT`, `parent_grant_ref` MUST be non-null. A non-null `parent_grant_ref` MUST identify `PARENT_RESOURCE_GRANT` as the authority-source family.

Required monotonic law:

```text
CHILD_RESOURCE_AUTHORITY
⊆
PARENT_RESOURCE_AUTHORITY
```

A child may narrow scope, resource classes, candidate/route binding, finite amount, attempt count, validity lifetime, and enforcement strictness. It MUST NOT silently broaden them.

A child scope is admissible only when the cross-artifact validator can prove:

```text
CHILD_SCOPE ⊆ PARENT_SCOPE
```

Equality is sufficient. A different `scope_ref` requires governed scope-relation evidence available to the validator. A missing or unknown scope relation fails closed. String inequality by itself is neither proof of narrowing nor proof of expansion.

Enforcement may become stricter:

```text
HARD_LIMIT → RESERVABLE_LIMIT → OBSERVATION_ONLY
```

The reverse is not automatically permitted. Observation-only authority cannot become spend authority in a child.

For finite blocking limits, ordinary capacity and protected finalization capacity are separately monotonic:

```text
CHILD_ORDINARY_LIMIT <= PARENT_ORDINARY_LIMIT
CHILD_FINALIZATION_RESERVE <= PARENT_FINALIZATION_RESERVE
```

Comparing only `ordinary_limit + finalization_reserve` is invalid because it can silently repurpose protected finalization capacity for ordinary work.

Cross-artifact narrowing is a contract law. RG-01 does not implement the runtime validator.

`CAPABILITY_AVAILABLE != RESOURCE_AUTHORIZED`.

## Multidimensional limits

A resource class may use multiple dimensions. Different dimensions MUST NOT be added as if they shared a unit.

Within one authority or aggregate surface, `(resource_class, dimension)` MUST be unambiguous. Duplicate entries that create competing quantities for the same key are invalid.

### HARD_LIMIT

A finite ceiling that MUST NOT knowingly be exceeded. Reservation is not required by this mode itself.

### RESERVABLE_LIMIT

A finite ceiling whose competing consumers MUST reserve capacity before governed consumption.

### OBSERVATION_ONLY

Telemetry/accounting only. It does not grant spend authority and does not independently block admission.

`OBSERVATION_ONLY` is not infinite authority.

An observation-only evaluation may have unavailable or unknown telemetry without blocking resource admission. Its evaluation MUST remain non-blocking; `METERING_UNAVAILABLE` or another telemetry unknown does not become `UNKNOWN_REQUIRED_RESOURCE` solely because the observation cannot be measured. The top-level admission unknown state represents unresolved blocking resource state, not observation-only telemetry quality.

## Finalization reserve

A finite blocking limit may separate:

```text
ordinary_limit
finalization_reserve
```

Normal work consumes ordinary capacity only.

Protected finalization capacity may be used only for bounded purposes authorized by the grant:

```text
RESULT_RECONCILIATION
DURABLE_PARTIAL_OUTPUT
FINAL_ACCOUNTING
CONTROL_HANDOFF
```

It MUST NOT be borrowed to continue ordinary depleted work.

## RESOURCE_ADMISSION

Resource admission binds the exact route, estimate, grant, and current availability evidence.

`ADMISSIBLE` requires all blocking resource evaluations to be admissible, no blocking reasons, and no unknown required blocking state.

Observation-only evaluations are explicitly non-blocking and therefore may remain admissible while carrying an observation-specific unknown state such as `METERING_UNAVAILABLE`.

Canonical blocking reasons include:

```text
GRANT_MISSING
AUTHORITY_SOURCE_UNRESOLVED
GRANT_SCOPE_MISMATCH
GRANT_EXPIRED
PARENT_AUTHORITY_VIOLATION
ESTIMATE_MISSING
ESTIMATE_ROUTE_MISMATCH
ROUTE_MISMATCH
HARD_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
RESERVABLE_LIMIT_INSUFFICIENT
UNKNOWN_REQUIRED_RESOURCE
UNCLASSIFIED_METERED_SIDE_EFFECT
OTHER_CONTRACT_BLOCK
```

Required fail-closed law:

```text
UNKNOWN REQUIRED RESOURCE
→ RESOURCE_ADMISSION = NOT_ADMISSIBLE
```

Unknown is not zero.

Resource admission does not alter semantic authority or executability proof.

## Metering quality and unknowns

`AUTHORITATIVE_ACTUAL` means actual usage from the governing measurement source. An `AUTHORITATIVE_ACTUAL` usage event MUST carry a non-empty `measurement_source_ref`; provenance without the governing measurement-source identity is insufficient for this quality claim.

`NORMALIZED_ACTUAL` means actual usage transformed into the canonical shape without changing factual meaning.

`ESTIMATED` is not actual usage.

`UNKNOWN` means no defensible quantity exists.

```text
UNKNOWN RESOURCE CONSUMPTION
!=
ZERO RESOURCE CONSUMPTION
```

For `METERING_QUALITY=UNKNOWN`, canonical quantity is null, not numeric zero.

Where a quantity depends materially on a valuation/quota revision, accounting preserves a durable revision/source reference so historical runs are not silently reinterpreted later.

## USAGE_EVENT

One `USAGE_EVENT` represents one resource class + one dimension for one logical operation.

It records run/operation identity, optional agent hierarchy, quantity or explicit unknown, metering quality, measurement-source reference, interpretation revision reference, and bounded start/finish observations where available.

`METERING_QUALITY=AUTHORITATIVE_ACTUAL` requires a non-null, non-empty `measurement_source_ref` identifying the governing measurement source.

Provider-specific response payloads do not belong in the core schema.

## RUN_ACCOUNTING

`RUN_ACCOUNTING` aggregates one run without collapsing different units.

It distinguishes:

```text
estimate != actual/observed totals
wall time != aggregate machine/agent time
```

It may record estimate comparison, exhaustion state, finalization-reserve use, termination reason, and unknown states.

It is factual/derived evidence, not acceptance authority.

## Parent-child invariants

Downstream enforcement must prove, where applicable:

- child scope is equal to or proven narrower than parent scope; unknown scope relation fails closed;
- child resource classes are a subset of parent classes;
- child ordinary finite amount is not greater than parent ordinary finite amount;
- child protected finalization reserve is not greater than parent protected finalization reserve;
- child attempt limit is not greater than parent attempt limit;
- child validity does not extend beyond parent validity;
- parent candidate/route bindings are preserved;
- limit mode is not relaxed;
- observation-only parent authority does not become spend authority.

The persistence/transaction mechanism is outside this contract.

## Contract-gap handling

```text
IMPLEMENTATION CONVENIENCE
!=
CONTRACT DEFECT
```

A downstream implementation MUST NOT alter this interface to fit a preferred backend, estimator representation, SDK field shape, workflow topology, or storage model.

If frozen semantics are genuinely insufficient:

```text
CONTRACT_GAP_FOUND
→ downstream STOP
→ bounded contract amendment
→ merge
→ exact-main re-freeze
→ downstream restart
```

The downstream workstream must identify the exact insufficient semantic requirement and show why the defect is contract-level rather than implementation-specific.

`CONTRACT_GAP_FOUND` does not authorize downstream mutation of RG-01.

## Cross-ownership boundaries

- #56 owns durable materialization/readback. RG-01 only requires Resource Governance artifacts to remain compatible with that law.
- #57 owns provider-neutral execution surfaces and brokers. Resource Governance consumes route identity; it does not own provider adapters.
- #59 owns HC1-HC4/autonomy. An autonomy envelope may source a bounded grant; higher autonomy is not unlimited resource authority.
- #61 owns proportional assurance, evidence ceilings, and control-loop hardening. Resource Governance consumes those semantics rather than duplicating them.
- #62 owns deferred Software capabilities. Test-design and CI-pipeline design remain downstream workstreams.

## Non-goals

RG-01 defines no:

- estimator algorithm;
- ledger backend;
- transaction mechanism;
- provider/model SDK;
- tokenizer/pricing implementation;
- CI workflow design;
- verification-plan or verification-policy contract;
- execution-surface discovery;
- Resolver mutation;
- role runtime change;
- new Engine;
- second Director.

The frozen interface is implementation-independent by design.
