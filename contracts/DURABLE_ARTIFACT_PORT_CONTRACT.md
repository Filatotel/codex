# Durable Artifact Port Contract — 56-B

This contract materializes the provider-neutral durable materialization and independent readback seam owned by parent issue #56.

It is deliberately smaller than a storage subsystem. It defines one portable boundary and one conformance backend. It does not select a real provider, create an Artifact/Storage Manager, or change Control/Verifier policy.

## Upstream A1 authority

56-B consumes the merged A1 laws without redefining them:

```text
ASSIGNMENT.required_durable_outputs
= opaque assignment-local output identities

EXECUTOR_RESULT.durable_output_refs
= opaque non-blank durable artifact refs bound to those identities

DURABLE REF PRESENT
!=
DURABLE READBACK PROVEN
```

The existing A1 assignment/result shapes remain valid.

## Mandatory distinctions

```text
SYSTEM-OF-RECORD IDENTITY
!=
PROVIDER MECHANICS

ARTIFACT REF
!=
LOCAL PATH

MATERIALIZATION SUCCESS
!=
CLAIM TRUTH

READBACK SUCCESS
!=
CLAIM VERIFICATION
```

`system_of_record_ref` is an explicit opaque semantic identity for the declared durable authority surface. Provider credentials, URL structures, filesystem layout, provider object models, browser state, and runtime mechanics stay behind the port.

A durable artifact ref is an opaque stable identity. A caller must not need the writer's local object identity, local output path, predecessor chat, or hidden in-memory state to resolve it.

Materialization success proves only that the exact payload was persisted by the declared durable surface and a durable ref was returned after that success. It does not prove factual claims carried by the payload.

Readback success proves only that the exact durable object can be independently resolved from the declared durable surface and that its content identity matches the durable ref. It does not verify factual claims inside the payload.

## Provider-neutral port

The portable capability is equivalent to:

```text
materialize(
    system_of_record_ref,
    output_identity,
    exact_payload_bytes
)
→ MaterializationResult

readback(
    system_of_record_ref,
    durable_artifact_ref
)
→ ReadbackObservation
```

The universal port requires no GitHub id, Drive id, URL, filesystem path, database key, browser identity, credential, or PAC state.

The payload surface is exact bytes. Domain artifact serialization/deserialization remains owned by the producing/consuming role rather than becoming a new repository-wide artifact ontology.

## Materialization result semantics

The bounded materialization outcomes are:

- `MATERIALIZED` — persistence succeeded; a non-empty `artifact_ref` and `content_digest` are returned.
- `MALFORMED_INPUT` — the portable operation input is structurally invalid.
- `WRONG_SYSTEM_OF_RECORD` — the requested system-of-record identity does not match the backend binding.
- `BACKEND_FAILURE` — the backend could not persist the object.

A non-successful materialization MUST NOT return a successful durable artifact ref.

## Readback observation semantics

The bounded readback outcomes are:

- `RESOLVED` — the exact persisted payload and stable identity were independently recovered.
- `UNRESOLVED` — a structurally valid ref is unknown/not found on the declared system of record.
- `WRONG_SYSTEM_OF_RECORD` — the request or persisted record is bound to a different system of record.
- `MALFORMED_INPUT` — the portable operation input/ref is malformed.
- `BACKEND_FAILURE` — the backend could not read or validate the persisted record.

These are port outcomes only. They are not Control Director terminal states and are not `VERIFICATION_RESULT` verdicts.

## Stable exact identity

56-B must expose enough deterministic identity for later 56-C enforcement.

The reference implementation uses:

```text
content_digest = SHA-256(exact_payload_bytes)

artifact_ref = opaque deterministic identity over:
  system_of_record_ref
  output_identity
  content_digest
```

Callers treat the artifact ref as opaque. The digest is content identity, not a signature or claim-verification mechanism.

Distinct output identities are part of the reference identity, so two distinct outputs with identical payload bytes do not silently alias. Re-materializing the same system-of-record ref + output identity + exact bytes is idempotent and returns the same durable ref.

## Reference backend

`tools/durable_artifact_port.py` provides `LocalFileDurableReferencePort` solely as a conformance/reference backend.

Its local `storage_root` is backend configuration and is not part of the universal operation shape or durable artifact ref.

The conformance proof requires:

```text
writer instance
→ materialize
→ discard writer-local state
→ fresh reader instance
→ readback(system_of_record_ref, artifact_ref)
→ exact payload recovered
```

The backend fails closed for wrong system-of-record bindings, unknown refs, malformed refs, corrupt/read failures, and write failures.

## 56-C boundary

56-B does not change `VERIFICATION_RESULT`, `resolve_transition()`, or Control advancement.

56-C may later consume these port outcomes and readback observations to enforce durable availability before advancing dependent work. Until then:

```text
READBACK CAPABILITY MATERIALIZED
!=
READBACK ENFORCEMENT MATERIALIZED
```

## Non-goals

This contract does not implement or select:

- GitHub, Google Drive, S3/R2/object-store, database, browser, or PAC adapters;
- provider credentials or provider-specific ids in universal semantics;
- a generic Artifact Manager, Storage Manager, Storage Engine, new Engine, or Director;
- claim verification;
- Control transition gating on readback;
- #58 lifecycle/session semantics;
- fresh-agent handoff contracts;
- Architecture Health;
- external execution tickets;
- Resource Governance redesign;
- migration of unrelated artifacts.
