# Canon Engine

`engines/canon/` owns the bounded lifecycle of **accepted project Canon**: establishing a Canon Foundation, registering explicit Canon state, reconciling evidence-backed findings into proposed Canon changes, classifying production-time Canon change, validating Canon coherence, freezing authorized Canon states, and reopening frozen Canon only through explicit authority.

Canon is an explicit governed declaration about the project that downstream work must preserve until it is explicitly superseded. A statement does not become Canon merely because it appears in research, implementation, prose, code, a test, a translation, a fixture, a report, or chat history.

## Ownership boundary

Canon Engine owns:

- Canon Foundation 0.x state construction and controlled freeze;
- accepted facts, protected values, assumptions, unknowns, intended ambiguities, contradictions, canonical registries and accepted decisions as governed Canon state;
- proposed and accepted Canon change records;
- research-to-Canon reconciliation **after** Research has produced evidence/findings;
- internal Canon validation and freeze-readiness checks;
- Canon freeze/reopen transitions when the assignment carries the required authority;
- Canon lifecycle support through 0.x, 1.0, production-time changes, final reconciliation and 2.0.

Canon Engine does **not** own:

- Owner/K0 authority or protected Owner intent itself;
- substantive Research truth generation, evidence collection, source evaluation, or research sufficiency decisions;
- Production Foundation design or downstream production organization;
- software implementation, narrative/manuscript production, translation/refraction, or interactive runtime realization;
- generic independent verification or release authority;
- universal artifact ontology, K0 routing, autonomous orchestration, or permanent agent personalities.

A Canon workflow may validate its own internal preconditions. That does not replace independent Verification Engine work when independent verification is required.

## Canon maturity lifecycle

```text
IDEA
→ CANON FOUNDATION 0.x
→ RESEARCH
→ CANON RECONCILIATION
→ CANON 1.0
→ PRODUCTION FOUNDATION
→ PRODUCTION
→ FINAL CANON RECONCILIATION
→ CANON 2.0
```

### Canon Foundation 0.x

A 0.x Foundation captures enough explicit Owner authority to create a stable research-entry baseline. It may intentionally contain assumptions, unknowns, unresolved contradictions, and explicit ambiguities. Freezing 0.x freezes the **known authority boundary and the explicit unknown state**; it does not pretend the unknowns are researched truth.

### Canon 1.0

Canon 1.0 follows evidence-backed Research plus explicit Canon reconciliation. Research findings are inputs to reconciliation, not accepted Canon by themselves. Canon 1.0 authorizes downstream Production Foundation and production only after its governing acceptance/freeze gates pass.

### Canon 2.0

Canon 2.0 is the final production-era reconciliation/freeze. It incorporates authorized production-era Canon changes and explicit final decisions. Post-2.0 change must use an explicit lifecycle mode: `ADDENDUM`, `EXPANSION`, `NEW_EDITION`, or `REOPEN`. Silent retcon is forbidden.

## Research boundary

The only valid default authority chain is:

```text
RESEARCH
→ EVIDENCE / FINDINGS
→ CANON RECONCILIATION
→ PROPOSED CANON CHANGE
→ EXPLICIT CANON AUTHORITY DECISION
→ ACCEPTED CANON
```

Never:

```text
RESEARCH → automatic Canon mutation
```

An implementation observation has the same boundary: it may motivate a change proposal, but `IMPLEMENTATION FACT != CANONICAL FACT`.

## Canon Foundation vs Production Foundation

Canon Foundation answers: **what is protected, accepted, assumed, unknown, ambiguous, contradictory, or decided for the project?**

Production Foundation answers: **how will a specific production be organized and built?**

The Canon Engine owns the first boundary only.

## Production-time Canon change classes

- **A — ENRICHMENT:** adds compatible detail without changing protected meaning or closing an explicitly open decision.
- **B — CLOSURE:** resolves a previously explicit unknown/open decision inside an already authorized scope.
- **C — PRODUCTION-REQUIRED CANONICAL CHANGE:** production exposes a change required for coherent realization; affected production pauses until explicit Canon authority resolves it.
- **D — CORE CHANGE / RETCON:** changes or contradicts protected/core Canon. This is a controlled stop/gate, never a silent production mutation.

These classes are Canon-specific and do not inherit the historical source repository's generic A–E change taxonomy.

## Durable artifacts

Canon workflows use durable state-bearing artifacts rather than chat memory. Core artifact types are:

- `CANON_FOUNDATION`
- `CANON_STATE`
- `CANON_CHANGE_PROPOSAL`
- `CANON_RECONCILIATION_RESULT`
- `CANON_FREEZE_RECORD`

Shared Project Resolver artifact/state/authority contracts remain normative; Canon does not create a competing universal artifact protocol.

## Roles

This migration creates no Canon personality or permanent agent role. Existing reusable roles are sufficient:

- `roles/executor/ROLE.md` performs bounded Canon work when the assignment authorizes it;
- `roles/control-director/ROLE.md` consumes results and manages gates/continuation within its authority;
- `roles/control-verifier/ROLE.md` remains owned by Verification Engine for independent claim verification.

## Progressive disclosure

Root routing selects `canon` only for semantic Canon capabilities. After selection, load `engines/canon/MANIFEST.yaml`, then only the selected workflow and required skill(s). Do not globally load this engine or recursively discover its skills.
