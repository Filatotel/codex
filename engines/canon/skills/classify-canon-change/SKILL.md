description: Classify a production-time Canon change as A Enrichment, B Closure, C Production-required Canonical Change, or D Core Change/Retcon and emit the required gate.
---

# Classes

- `A_ENRICHMENT`: compatible detail; no protected semantic change and no closure of an explicit open decision.
- `B_CLOSURE`: resolves an explicit unknown/open decision within already authorized scope.
- `C_PRODUCTION_REQUIRED_CANONICAL_CHANGE`: coherent production requires changing accepted Canon.
- `D_CORE_CHANGE_RETCON`: changes/contradicts protected/core Canon or project identity.

# Procedure

1. Lock exact Canon state and production observation.
2. Identify affected Canon IDs/protected values and downstream dependencies.
3. Determine the weakest class that fully describes semantic impact; never downgrade to avoid a gate.
4. Construct class, rationale, evidence/observation refs, affected scope, required authority and revalidation obligations; classification/proposal output remains non-accepted by default.
5. If the resulting `CANON_CHANGE_PROPOSAL` would be durably materialized with `status: ACCEPTED`, structurally validate it and call `guard_mutation_materialization()` from `engines/canon/tools/mutation_authority.py` with workflow id `manage_production_canon_change` and the governed supplied artifacts. Continue only on `PROVEN`; a rejected gate forbids accepted output/resulting Canon state.
6. C pauses affected production pending explicit Canon resolution. D triggers controlled stop and explicit Owner/Canon authority.

# Boundary

This Canon-specific A-D model supersedes the source repository's generic change A-E taxonomy for this engine.

## Execution contract

**Required execution capabilities for mandatory steps:**
- `durable_artifact_write`

**Supported execution modes:** assignment-bound Canon reasoning over supplied or already-resolved artifacts.

**Conditional / optional capabilities:** none by default. Repository, shell, network, browser, database, or Research acquisition capabilities must be separately declared by the selected assignment/workflow when genuinely mandatory.

**Mandatory evidence path:** emit an envelope-compatible Canon classification/change artifact with exact `input_state_ref`, provenance and related artifact refs. Accepted output requires a `PROVEN` result from `engines/canon/tools/mutation_authority.py`; non-accepted classification/proposal output requires no mutation authority.

If the exact destination cannot prove the mandatory durable-output capability, return `ASSIGNMENT_NOT_ADMISSIBLE`; do not weaken the evidence requirement.
