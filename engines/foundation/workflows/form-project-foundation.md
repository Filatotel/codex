# Workflow: Form Project Foundation

**Workflow ID:** form_project_foundation

## Role contract

- executing_role: `roles/executor/ROLE.md`
- consuming_role: `roles/control-director/ROLE.md`
- required_skills:
  - `engines/foundation/skills/develop-project-seed/SKILL.md`
  - `engines/foundation/skills/define-project-outcome/SKILL.md`
  - `engines/foundation/skills/classify-consequential-unknowns/SKILL.md`
  - `engines/foundation/skills/plan-project-topology/SKILL.md`
- optional_skills:
  - `engines/foundation/skills/design-discovery/SKILL.md` only when exploration materially improves the working project definition.

## Entry

- Liaison selected ROUTE for governed project formation;
- exact Owner material/provenance, assignment identity and destination executability are established;
- durable system of record and capabilities for bootstrap/readback are declared.

## Required durable outputs and sequencing

The assignment-declared required_durable_outputs must include:
- PROJECT_SEED
- PROJECT_OUTCOME
- CONSEQUENTIAL_UNKNOWN_MAP
- TOPOLOGY_PLAN
- PROJECT_TOPOLOGY_BOOTSTRAP (one logical transaction containing TOPOLOGY_MANIFEST, PROJECT_INDEX and minimal structural shell)

The first four are non-authoritative WORKING bootstrap/control state. They MAY materialize before topology admission without circularity. Their durable_output_refs must be independently read back through the existing generic durable-output/readback contract.

The fifth output is an atomic logical bootstrap package persisted through the same generic durable port. A local/session copy and a bare artifact ref do not prove completion. The package has a root index, declared semantic namespaces, bounded namespace navigation indexes and minimal structural shell. It MUST be independently read back and passed through tools.project_topology.verify_bootstrap (cold-start navigation proof) before TOPOLOGY_ADMITTED. For a real provider, exact physical index/shell materialization and its independent readback must also be proven when required; a reference-backend logical shell is not a claim that GitHub or Drive directories were created.

FOUNDATION_READY_FOR_OWNER_GATE requires durable coverage, independent readback of all declared outputs, independently verified topology/cold-start navigation, and any assignment-required provider physical shell proof. Missing evidence yields a bounded blocker, not readiness. The status does not create Owner/K0 authority and it does not create Canon authority.

## Procedure

1. Consume bounded Liaison routing frame, exact Owner material and relevant admitted state.
2. Use develop-project-seed to preserve explicit Owner statements separately from model interpretation, proposals and unresolved questions.
3. Use define-project-outcome to define required outcome and whether downstream realization is needed, without presuming software.
4. Use optional design-discovery only when materially useful.
5. Use classify-consequential-unknowns; classification is not Research dispatch or fact resolution.
6. Reconcile PROJECT_SEED, PROJECT_OUTCOME and CONSEQUENTIAL_UNKNOWN_MAP as working artifacts.
7. Use plan-project-topology to derive minimal semantic classes, project-specific namespaces and navigation indexes from the actual outcome; no fixed folder template or agent/date/run directory.
8. Produce TOPOLOGY_PLAN as WORKING/non-authoritative and verify against topology-plan schema.
9. Build and materialize a single PROJECT_TOPOLOGY_BOOTSTRAP through the existing durable materialization/readback surface. Its contents are TOPOLOGY_MANIFEST, PROJECT_INDEX and the minimal structural shell. Do not admit project payload yet.
10. Require independent readback and cold-start proof from the root index to each namespace index, current Canon pointer (which may be explicitly unset before Owner gate), and required workstream locations. No global search or file-by-file enumeration.
11. Reconcile required_durable_outputs with exact durable_output_refs and independent readback proofs. A failed bootstrap or missing physical materialization proof MUST leave downstream payload blocked.
12. Only after full completion return FOUNDATION_READY_FOR_OWNER_GATE and STOP. Do not execute Owner Foundation Gate, Canon acceptance/mutation, Research dispatch or Production.

## Persistent project payload law (later stages)

BOOTSTRAP / CONTROL STATE != PROJECT PAYLOAD.

Research findings, sources, evidence, decisions, Canon, long-lived production/runtime payload and archives MUST resolve a semantic class and scope against the current admitted topology before persistent materialization. The worker's pathname is not authority. Use tools.project_topology.materialize_project_payload as the provider-neutral semantic pre-write front door, and the existing durable port for physical bytes/readback. Unknown class, missing scope, ad hoc top-level path or unverified topology yields TOPOLOGY_CHANGE_REQUIRED or fail-closed equivalent.

Later writers must re-resolve every project payload address (anti-entropy); topology admission is not a one-time exemption. TOPOLOGY_EXTENSION adds an admitted semantic namespace. TOPOLOGY_REPLACEMENT replaces existing canonical addresses only after the existing Owner architecture choice PRESERVE/MIGRATE vs DESTRUCTIVE CUTOVER, migration/readback proof, index/ref reconciliation and retirement of the old-current topology. No parallel current realities.

## Cognitive and stop boundary

This workflow is guidance-first. Zero clarification questions is valid; no fixed questionnaire is imposed. The bootstrap is not authoritative Canon. On missing provenance, executability, durable readback, cold-start navigation or legitimate topology-change authority, STOP with the smallest bounded blocker. No second Engine, filesystem manager or Foundation-specific spawn runtime is introduced.
